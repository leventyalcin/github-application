#### What makes me a great fit?

Communication, passion, and awareness are the most important prerequisites to build an awesome tool.

Unless the pain points are properly assessed and understood, it doesn't matter what you build, because chances are the tool you build won't be solving the actual problem a user is having.

Understanding a workflow or tooling problem requires understanding where someone is coming from technically and emotionally.

I'm a person who has the initiative, passion, and dedication to seek out the feedback and conversations required to understand what Hubbers need. I do this by asking, listening, and iterating.
Having graduated from Dev Bootcamp, I enjoy empathizing with others, which will make it easier to understand what the problem is before I build a solution.

I'm most passionate about systems. I keep a list of workflow annoyances and tips on hand, I iterate on my solutions, I spend time on Stack Overflow and the Atom discussion board. I do this because it feels great to be part of a community, and also because when you post a great question and solution it paves the way for others to benefit from your solution.

I'm passionate about not just finding a solution and moving on, instead I find a solution and then think how I can make a blog post about it, a discussion board post, a YouTube video, or do a presentation on it.

As a Support Tools Application Engineer, my default needs to be understanding the ecosystem, both its resources and limitations, in order to adequately address the problem at hand.

What are the pain points related to? Has anyone solved this problem already? Has anyone solved a problem like this? Is this a problem worth solving? These are the questions I ask first, which increases the possibility of solving a problem quickly and effectively.

I'm most excited about building tools that follow Eric Raymond's 17 [Unix Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). This is because it increases the chance that my tool can be part of a pipeline. The fact that my first choice is to build a tool that is [well behaved](https://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-05/what-makes-an-awesome-commandline-application) increases the chances that the tools I build will continue to remain flexible and help others even as the overall system of GitHub grows and changes.
