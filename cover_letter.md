Flexible technologies like web hooks, integrations, and the new GraphQL API make GitHub the “hub” for software development. It’s awesome because instead of trying to predict everything a user will do, GitHub is making it possible for users to do things no one can predict. The platform plays nice with tools developers are using.

As a company, GitHub sells infrastructure as a service and premium subscriptions.  The current "Version Control and Code Management Wars" feel eerily similar to the "Browser Wars" of the 1990s. Marc Andreessen himself is one of the main investors in GitHub!

Now, Microsoft is shipping one-size-fits-all products like Team Foundation Services. GitHub needs to continue to innovate solutions that position GitHub as the hub and platform for collaborative software development.

The problem is being flexible is hard, uncertain, and unpredictable.  The solution is to continue building, iterating and innovating on tools and systems internally that foster more open collaboration and communication. Hubbers need the right tools to keep building software together.

As an Support Tools Application Engineer, this is where I want to help. I passionately believe that if you provide creative and resourceful people with the right tools, then innovation and quality work will happen. By learning about and iterating on the ecosystems of tools that Hubbers use every day, I know I can impactful and useful contributions at GitHub.

Thank you so much for reading my application. I  am deeply grateful for your time and would love the opportunity to continue with an interview.

All my best,
Max Bigras
