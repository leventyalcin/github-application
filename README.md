#### Why do you want to work at GitHub?

I want to work at GitHub as a Support Tools Application Engineer because this role combines my 3 biggest passions: helping developers become more efficient and effective, collaborating on projects using the GitHub Flow, and solving real problems for real people.

The biggest problem a Hubber faces is not having time to address inefficiencies and issues in their workflow and systems, while still building a useful and awesome platform for GitHub’s users.

At Nathan Henderson's and Kyle Macey's ChatOps talk at GitHub Universe’s training sessions, I saw how GitHub as a company builds workflows and tooling around Slack, Hubot, and GitHub. Operations are performed in the open so other people in the company can be aware of what is going on. I love this open, collaborative process because it makes it possible to have a short feedback loop on the tools I build.

I want to build on the ecosystem of tools that solves complex problems in the open, like Hubot and Campfire.

To be a Hubber with the goal of solving workflow and tooling problems for other Hubbers would be a dream come true!

#### What makes you a great fit?

Communication, passion, and awareness are the most important prerequisites to build an awesome tool.

Unless the pain points are properly assessed and understood, it doesn't matter what you build, because chances are the tool you build won't be solving the actual problem a user is having.

Understanding a workflow or tooling problem requires understanding where someone is coming from technically and emotionally.

I'm a person who has the initiative, passion, and dedication to seek out the feedback and conversations required to understand what Hubbers need. I do this by asking, listening, and iterating.
Having graduated from Dev Bootcamp, I enjoy empathizing with others, which will make it easier to understand what the problem is before I build a solution.

I'm most passionate about systems. I keep a list of workflow annoyances and tips on hand, I iterate on my solutions, I spend time on Stack Overflow and the Atom discussion board. I do this because it feels great to be part of a community, and also because when you post a great question and solution it paves the way for others to benefit from your solution.

I'm passionate about not just finding a solution and moving on, instead I find a solution and then think how I can make a blog post about it, a discussion board post, a YouTube video, or do a presentation on it.

As a Support Tools Application Engineer, my default needs to be understanding the ecosystem, both its resources and limitations, in order to adequately address the problem at hand.

What are the pain points related to? Has anyone solved this problem already? Has anyone solved a problem like this? Is this a problem worth solving? These are the questions I ask first, which increases the possibility of solving a problem quickly and effectively.

I'm most excited about building tools that follow Eric Raymond's 17 [Unix Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). This is because it increases the chance that my tool can be part of a pipeline. The fact that my first choice is to build a tool that is [well behaved](https://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-05/what-makes-an-awesome-commandline-application) increases the chances that the tools I build will continue to remain flexible and help others even as the overall system of GitHub grows and changes.

#### Cover Letter
Flexible technologies like web hooks, integrations, and the new GraphQL API make GitHub the “hub” for software development. It’s awesome because instead of trying to predict everything a user will do, GitHub is making it possible for users to do things no one can predict. The platform plays nice with tools developers are using.

As a company, GitHub sells infrastructure as a service and premium subscriptions.  The current "Version Control and Code Management Wars" feel eerily similar to the "Browser Wars" of the 1990s. Marc Andreessen himself is one of the main investors in GitHub! 

Now, Microsoft is shipping one-size-fits-all products like Team Foundation Services. GitHub needs to continue to innovate solutions that position GitHub as the hub and platform for collaborative software development.

The problem is being flexible is hard, uncertain, and unpredictable.  The solution is to continue building, iterating and innovating on tools and systems internally that foster more open collaboration and communication. Hubbers need the right tools to keep building software together.

As an Support Tools Application Engineer, this is where I want to help. I passionately believe that if you provide creative and resourceful people with the right tools, then innovation and quality work will happen. By learning about and iterating on the ecosystems of tools that Hubbers use every day, I know I can impactful and useful contributions at GitHub.

Thank you so much for reading my application. I  am deeply grateful for your time and would love the opportunity to continue with an interview. 

All my best, 
Max Bigras
