#### Why do I want to work at GitHub?

Because I want to help developers at GitHub solve their workflow and tooling problems.

I know what it feels like to use an awful process but not have time to address it because of a looming deadline. It feels awful. It basically feels like sitting in traffic while the carpool lane is wide open, and you see your friend in the car next to you...also sitting in traffic.

 I know what it feels like to think if I just had more time to work on my tooling and technique then my overall development experience would be so much more enjoyable, but the actual project goals tend to be the higher priority. I'm sure there are many Hubbers in a similar situation.

This is where I want to help! As a Support Tools Application Engineer, I want to be the person who works to solve those problems. Configuration management, the classic "it works on my machine" mysteries, piping two tools together that don't seem to want to talk to each other, building a slick CLI app that talks to Slack. These are all problems I get excited about.

At Nathan Henderson's and Kyle Macey's ChatOps talk at GitHub Universeâ€™s training sessions, I saw how GitHub as a company builds workflows and tooling around Slack, Hubot, and GitHub. Operations are performed in the open so other people in the company can be aware of what is going on.

The overall message I took away from the talk is: Hubbers include the entire company in the development process. It's cool because I could have a super short feedback loop on the tools I'm building. That's the fun part, finding out from people what's working and what needs to be changed, and then iterating.

Because as much as it feels awful to use a broken process again and again, it feels amazing once that hangup gets addressed. I want to be the person at GitHub who takes the time to make the dev process awesome!
