#### Why do you want to work at GitHub?

I want to work at GitHub as a Support Tools Application Engineer because this role combines my 3 biggest passions: helping developers become more efficient and effective, collaborating on projects using the GitHub Flow, and solving real problems for real people.

The biggest problem a Hubber faces is not having time to address inefficiencies and issues in their workflow and systems, while still building a useful and awesome platform for GitHub’s users.

At Nathan Henderson's and Kyle Macey's ChatOps talk at GitHub Universe’s training sessions, I saw how GitHub as a company builds workflows and tooling around Slack, Hubot, and GitHub. Operations are performed in the open so other people in the company can be aware of what is going on. I love this open, collaborative process because it makes it possible to have a short feedback loop on the tools I build.

I want to build on the ecosystem of tools that solves complex problems in the open, like Hubot and Campfire.

To be a Hubber with the goal of solving workflow and tooling problems for other Hubbers would be a dream come true!
